This README.md, I created so that I have all the rules and instructions on my App to read it easier when working on the challenge.

Level 1 Challenge:

Write a React app which displays high score tables for the given data.

Each country must have its own High Score table displayed.

Your app must be hosted on Netlify (see "Hosting" below).

You must make AT LEAST:

HighScoreTable - a table with a country name and a list of player-scores for that country.
PlayerScore - component responsible for displaying a single score by one player (e.g. as one line of the table) (e.g. Neill 2000)

Getting Start:

Copy across the score file (or the score file's contents) from this repo to your app, and then import from that file.

Write a plain HTML prototype first for two or three countries (e.g. on codepen). THEN, once you know the HTML you're attempting to create, work on the React version! This is not mandatory but it is recommended.

The Data:

The data is available in the file ./scores.js on the original github repo.
You can copy this array of data into your App.js or you can import it.

Hosting:

Add your project in github and host it on Netlify.

The github repo name should be: high-scores-react

The netlify site suffix should be -scores

so...

cyf-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME-scores.
